# Layer
>  `definitions.Layer`

The Layer class can be used to generate information of a layer in the mask design. The instance
of the class should also be used in the creation of geometries in different symbols.
To get a valid instance of the Layer class, instantiate a CIFFile class and call the
[CIFFile.createLayer](../CIFFile.md#createlayer) method.

### Hierarchy

        - [CIFWriter](./CIFWriter.md)
            - **Layer**

## Constructor
> `obj = Layer(fileHandle, layerId, name, styling)`

Create an instance of a Layer object that is responsible for managing the information about a layer type in a CIF design.

#### Inputs
- `fileHandle`: *int32* The file handle to the CIF file
- `layerId`: *uint32* The id of the layer (generated by a CIFFile instance)
- `name`: *string* The name of the layer (as used by CleWin)
- **optional** `styling`: *string = ["0f808080" "0f808080"]* The optional styling of the layer, uses syntax of CleWin, will be updated later

#### Returns [Layer](#layer)

## Properties
### **SetPrivate** layerId: *double* The id of the layer (generated by a CIFFile instance)
### **SetPrivate** name: *string* The name of the layer (as used by CleWin)
### **SetPrivate** styling: *string(1, 2)* The optional styling of the layer, uses syntax of CleWin, will be updated later

## Methods
### printLayer
> `obj = obj.printLayer()`

Add a line to the CIF file to indicate that the next geometries are using this layer.

#### Inputs

#### Returns [self](#layer)

### **static** NoLayer
> `noLayer = Layer.NoLayer()`

Get a layer that should not be used in any application, but is used as a general placeholder.

#### Inputs

#### Returns [Layer](#layer)

## Overloaded Operators
> `iseq = obj.eq(layer)` Overloaded comparison between two [Layer](#layer) instances

> `isneq = obj.neq(layer)` Overloaded negated comparison between two [Layer](#layer) instances
